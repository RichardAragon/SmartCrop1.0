# Smart Crop 1.0

Smart Crop 1.0 is an open source project that aims to save the world by reducing water consumption and pesticide usage in agriculture. It uses a hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) model to predict soil moisture from meteorological and land use data, and provides optimal irrigation scheduling for different crops.

## Features

- Uses a hybrid CNN-GRU model to capture the spatial and temporal features of the input data
- Uses mutual information to select the most relevant features for the model
- Uses mean squared error (MSE) as the loss function and adaptive moment estimation (Adam) as the optimizer
- Uses MinMaxScaler to normalize the data between [0,1]
- Uses train_test_split to split the data into training and validation sets
- Uses matplotlib and seaborn to plot the results and evaluate the model
- Provides sample input and output data in CSV format

## Installation

To install Smart Crop 1.0, you need to have Python 3.7 or higher and the following libraries:

- torch
- numpy
- pandas
- sklearn
- keras
- tensorflow
- pydantic

You can install these libraries using pip or conda. For example:

`pip install torch numpy pandas sklearn keras tensorflow pydantic`

Alternatively, you can use the requirements.txt file to install all the dependencies at once:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

To use Smart Crop 1.0, you need to have an input CSV file containing the following variables:

- temp: temperature in degrees Celsius
- humidity: relative humidity in percentage
- precipitation: precipitation in millimeters
- windspeed: wind speed in meters per second
- soiltype: soil type code from MODIS
- vegcover: vegetation cover code from MODIS
- landuse: land use code from SILO
- soi: Southern Oscillation Index from GLDAS
- soilmoisture: soil moisture in percentage

You can find sample input data in the input_dataset.csv file.

To run the model, you need to execute the main.py file using the following command:

`python main.py`

The model will train on the input data and output the predicted soil moisture values in a CSV file called output_dataset.csv. It will also plot the learning curves, the loss curves, and the performance metrics, as well as the predicted vs actual soil moisture values.
